# Quick notes:
# Figurines names should be written from the perspective of someone who *doesn't* know your character, i.e. "Green Lizard Figurine", "Pink Moth Figurine", "Yellow Slime CMO Figurine", e.t.c.
# Descriptions should be written in the form of "A figurine depicting...", and again, written from the perspective of someone who *doesn't* know your character
# Our figurines use the "BaseFigurineMoff" parent
