    content: "Hacked together using spare electronic scraps, the RFID chip normally used to scan ID cards has been reversed to instead transmit the encryption key for maintenance access. Reverse engineering access keys like this is extremely difficult, although the ubiquitous nature of passenger IDs with maintenance access means this particular key is very well known."
