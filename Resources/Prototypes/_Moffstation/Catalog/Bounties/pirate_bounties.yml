# We need to be careful how we balance these, as we dont want to bankroll them to quickly
# take into account risk/difficulty of stealing a certain bounty
# make things less if we want to disincentivize it being stolen
# Also, make sure theres enough disruptive bounties so that they dont just become symbiotic with the crew
