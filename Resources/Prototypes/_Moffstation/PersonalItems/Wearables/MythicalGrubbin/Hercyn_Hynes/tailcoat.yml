    content: "A fitted, almost perfect looking suit with a bit more flexibility than you would think. To look so pristine, it must be treated with utmost care by it's owner. A small 'CS' sits engraved into the left wristcuff. You don't want to imagine what things might have been done while one was wearing this."
