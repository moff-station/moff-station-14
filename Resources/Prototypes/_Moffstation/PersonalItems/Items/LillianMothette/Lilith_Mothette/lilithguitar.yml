    content: The guitar is covered in crayon marks that seem to be left by a child. The strings are heavily scratched, with one string looking like a cheap replacement. The head is taped on and somehow still holding. On the base, there are two stickers; one you find familiar, but can't put your finger on it. The other has the letters LT in a bright pink. On the back of the body is an engraving of the name Lilith Mothette.
