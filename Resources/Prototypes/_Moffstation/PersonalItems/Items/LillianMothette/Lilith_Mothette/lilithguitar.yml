    content: On the back of the guitar there is an engraving of the name Lilith Mothette. All over it there is crayon marks that seem to be left by a child. There are scratch marks all around the srings.  One of the strings also is a completely different one making it look like a cheap replacement. The head of the guitar is also taped on and somehow still holding. On the base there are two stickers; one you find familiar, but cant put your finger on it. The other has the letters LT in a bright pink.
