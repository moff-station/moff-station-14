# Hi! Welcome! This is how you make a deck of cards!

# Define the deck by inheriting from the base deck and referencing a deck prototype.

  sprite: _EstacaoPirata/Objects/Misc/Cards/card_black.rsi # This RSI will be used by default for all generated cards, unless another is specified on that specific card.
  commonObverseSprite: # Layers specified here will be applied to all generated cards in this deck. They appear visually under layers specified on the specific card.
  - state: background
  commonReverseSprite: # Same as obverse, but for the back. Generated cards can't add layers to these.
  - state: singlecard_down
  cardLocPrefix: "cards-demo" # This string is prepended to generated cards' IDs to get the localization strings for their names and descriptions. By default, the name comes out to be "{cardLocPrefix}-{cardId}-name", and the description is "{cardLocPrefix}-{cardId}-description".
  cards: # Here are the actual cards that'll end up in this deck:
  - id: ace_spades # If you specify just an ID, the obverse sprite will be a single layer with the RSI specified above and a state with the same ID.
  - id: ace_hearts
    obverseSprite: # Generated cards can override the obverse sprite by specifying layers.
    - sprite: _EstacaoPirata/Objects/Misc/Cards/card_syndicate.rsi # You can specify the RSI to use as well...
      state: background
    - state: ace_hearts # ... though by default, it uses the RSI defined in the deck proto above.
  - prototype: SyndicateBusinessPlayingCard # Instead of generating cards, you can just reference an entire other entity prototype and it'll end up in the deck. Make sure it has a PlayingCard component!
  - id: ace_diamonds
    faceDown: true # Cards can be spawned in either facing state...
  - prototype: SyndicateBusinessPlayingCard
    faceDown: true # ... even if they're a prototype reference.

# Unique prototype for putting into the demo deck.
