  ## Health
  Resomi have lower health due to their small stature, falling into a critical state at [color=#ffa500]85[/color] points of damage and dying at [color=#ffa500]170[/color] points of damage.
  Resomi also prefer colder temperatures compared to humans, being roughly akin to Moths.

  ## Claw attack
  Resomi are able to slash at others with their claws.
  These attacks deal [color=red]5[/color] points of Slash damage with a hit rate that is the same as humans fists attack.

  ## Weapon Knockback
  Resomi are very lightweight, and as such take so much knockback from large caliber weapons that they get pushed around.
  Resomi also will receive [color=yellow]Stun Damage[/color] from large caliber weapons for each shot.
  In general, the weapons that will give you knockback are [color=yellow]Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, LMGs, HMGs, and Grenade Launchers.[/color]
  Look out especially on Rocket launchers, as since they are recoil-less, you will actually get [color=red]pulled forward with the rocket[/color] for a short distance.
  The safest weapons to use that will give you no knockback are [color=green]Pistols and SMGs[/color].
  No slips can help mitigate some of the knockback from firing weapons, but not all of it!
