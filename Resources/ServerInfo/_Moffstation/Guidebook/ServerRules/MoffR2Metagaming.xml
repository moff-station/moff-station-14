  # Section 2: Metagaming

  2.1 Do not metagame (i.e. using or sharing information that your character has no way of knowing or obtaining, such as knowledge on the exact loadouts of antagonists, or things seen or heard while dead).
  - At any point in the game if someone were to ask you why your character is doing what they're doing, you should be able to provide a reasonable in-character explanation.

  2.2 Do not metacommunicate - [textlink="See the extended description of this rule." link="MoffMetacomming"]

  2.3 Do not metagrudge nor metafriend. That is, treating a character unfairly solely based on the out-of-character relationship with the player; or treating them unfairly beyond acceptable and reasonable conduct - for example, attacking on sight - because of in-character interactions in previous rounds.

  2.4 Players are allowed to retain and share knowledge of past experiences and prior shifts. However, treating a character unfairly solely based on happenings outside of the current round, is forbidden (for example, treating someone with more or less suspicion or trust solely based on how often they are an antagonist).

  2.5 Players are allowed to form in-character relationships (friends, foes, or otherwise). However, providing high profile unfair advantages or disadvantages solely based on those IC relationships, is forbidden (for example, ignoring serious crimes, demoting, barring from services, giving out abnormally high access, handing out normally highly restricted items, etc.). If you are unsure or got a particular idea, ask in AHelp for approval.
