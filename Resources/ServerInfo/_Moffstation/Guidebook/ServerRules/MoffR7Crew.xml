  # Section 7: Crew

  7.1 Try not to engage in tasks that do not fall under the purview of your job. Doing something in a pinch is alright, and so is helping out someone that you see is struggling a bit. But otherwise, let each role do their job. Exceptions can be made for emergencies, and during severe personnel shortages in a department. All job changes and increases of responsibilities should be approved by the Head of Personnel (HoP) and/or the Captain.

  7.2 Do not validhunt. It's okay to help security if they're understaffed or the situation calls for it, but under normal circumstances you should not be seeking out conflict with antags.
  - You may assist security in fighting threats which threaten the whole station, so long as you are not abandoning your role unreasonably.

  7.3 Do not join the round as a role that you don't intend to play. Do not enable antagonist roles that you don't intend to play.

  7.4 As a Command member, do not put yourself unnecessarily in obviously dangerous situations that go beyond your normal duties and responsibilities, unless in emergency or under great roleplay.
