  # Section 7: Crew

  [bold]7.1[/bold] Try not to engage in tasks that do not fall under the purview of your job. Doing something in a pinch is alright, and so is helping out someone that you see is struggling a bit. But otherwise, let each role do their job.
  - Exceptions can be made for emergencies, and during severe personnel shortages in a department.

  [bold]7.2[/bold] Do not validhunt. It's okay to help security if they're understaffed or the situation calls for it, but under normal circumstances you should not be seeking out conflict with antags.
  - You may assist security in fighting threats which threaten the whole station, so long as you are not abandoning your role unreasonably.

  [bold]7.3[/bold] Do not join the round as a role that you don't intend to play. Do not enable antagonist roles that you don't intend to play.

  [bold]7.4[/bold] As a Command or Security member, you are expected to uphold the integrity of the station and follow Space Law.
