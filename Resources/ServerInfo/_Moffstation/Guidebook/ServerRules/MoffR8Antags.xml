  # Section 8: Antagonists

  8.1 Damage by any antagonist role must be proportional to their related objectives. Damaging irreplaceable or critical station infrastructure shouldn't be done without good reason. Rarely, if ever, is station-wide destruction and mass killing justifiable. Ask an Admin via AHelp if you are unsure of whether the level of damage you want to cause is acceptable or not. The Die a Glorious Death objective overrides this rule, and allows for any form of station destruction outside of safe-havens.

  8.2 Friendly antagging (playing a solo antagonist or team antagonist as a free agent or crew-aligned role) is explicitly forbidden unless permission is granted by an admin. Please get permission via AHelp before playing a normally antagonistic role as friendly.

  8.3 The role of an antagonist is to make the game more fun, exciting and interesting, not miserable, unfun and frustrating. As such, try to play out the role accordingly, focusing not on winning, but on making things more thrilling and entertaining.

  8.4 Antagonists are not required to pursue their objectives. However, they are expected to cause chaos in some form.

  8.5 Keep round removal to a minimum. Under most circumstances it is unnecessary to round remove someone who is not your objective. As an antag you are not required to prevent anyone from being round removed, but you shouldn't be actively seeking it out if it's unnecessary.
