  # Section 8: Antagonists

  [bold]8.1[/bold] Damage by any antagonist role must be proportional to their objectives.
  - Ask an Admin via AHelp if you are unsure of whether the level of damage you want to cause is acceptable or not.
  - The Die a Glorious Death objective overrides this rule, and allows for any form of station destruction outside of safe-havens.

  [bold]8.2[/bold] Antagonists are not required to pursue their objectives, and are free to pursue goals of their own. However, they are expected to cause chaos in some form.

  [bold]8.3[/bold] Friendly antagging (playing a solo antagonist or team antagonist as a free agent or crew-aligned role) is explicitly forbidden.
  - Please get permission via AHelp before playing a normally antagonistic role as friendly.

  [bold]8.4[/bold] The role of an antagonist is to add chaos to the round, making it more entertaining. We encourage people to do interesting gimmicks or antics even if they're outside the scope of their objectives.

  [bold]8.5[/bold] Keep round removal to a minimum. Under most circumstances it is unnecessary to round remove someone who is not your objective.
  - As an antag you are not required to prevent anyone from being round removed, but you shouldn't be actively seeking it out if it's unnecessary.
