  [color=#a4885c]Execution and DNRs:[/color] A humane way of dealing with extremely unruly crewmates. Within reason, a prisoner who has been given the death sentence may pick how they wish to be killed, common methods are firing line, lethal injection, exile, and high voltage electrocution. Another alternate method of "execution" is the process of placing a staff's mind into a borg, this is allowed so long as it is lawful. Additionally, a Do-Not-Revive order can be placed on criminals who are deemed to be worthy of execution but are killed before being detained. Execution and DNRs can only be issued with [color=green]Centcomm approval[/color].
