  ## [color=#a4885c]Execution and DNRs:[/color]
  A humane way of dealing with extremely unruly crewmates. Within reason, a prisoner who has been given the death sentence may pick how they wish to be killed, common methods are firing line, lethal injection, exile, and high voltage electrocution. Another alternate method of "execution" is the process of placing a staff's mind into a borg, this is allowed so long as it is lawful. Additionally, a Do-Not-Revive order can be placed on criminals who are deemed to be worthy of execution but are killed before being detained. Execution and DNRs can only be issued with [color=green]Centcomm approval[/color].

  ## Foreign Invaders
  Hostile non-crew elements who threaten the safety of the crew should be put into confinement when possible. If security is unable to effectively keep them detained, execution is recommended.

  ## Major Punishments
  [color=#a4885c]Permanent Confinement:[/color] Being held in the permanent brig for the entire duration of the shift. A person is eligible for permanent confinement if their timed sentence would exceed 30 minutes. Any persons subject to this punishment are required to be transported in cuffs to CentComm at the end of the shift. A permanent prisoner can not be deprived of anything covered by the section "Treatment Of Prisoners".
