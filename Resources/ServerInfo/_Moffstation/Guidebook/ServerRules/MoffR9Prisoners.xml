  # Section 9: Prisoners
  Preface: This section only applies to non-antagonist crew and prisoners, who have wound up serving time in jail. Antagonists of any kind can ignore this section entirely.

  9.1 Do not initiate breakouts. Being imprisoned doesn't make you an antagonist, you are expected to not cause undue trouble while you are in jail. Exception is made if where you are being held becomes uninhabitable or otherwise dangerous to stay in.

  9.2 You may break out under reasonable circumstances. If the cell or its doors have been damaged in such a way that allows you to simply walk out, then you are permitted to make an escape attempt. Keep in mind this does not make you an antagonist, and you are still bound to the normal rules of non-antags.
