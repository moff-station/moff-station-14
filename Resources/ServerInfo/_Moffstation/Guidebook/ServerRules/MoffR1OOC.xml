  # Section 1: Out Of Character

  [bold]1.1[/bold] Be polite, civil, and respectful towards other players and admins. Always bear in mind, that behind every and each player-controlled entity, there is a real person, each with their own feelings, emotions, preferences, and thoughts.

  [bold]1.2[/bold] Have fun. Everyone is here to have an enjoyable and relaxing time with one another. Generally, one should aim to perform actions that will make the game more fun for everyone involved, not just themselves.

  [bold]1.3[/bold] Hate speech is forbidden. This applies to both OOC, but also IC interactions. Usage of terms and behavior born out of sheer hate or bigotry, will be punished. Playful consensual banter is permitted.

  [bold]1.4[/bold] Usage of third party cheat software and exploits is forbidden.

  [bold]1.5[/bold] Doing anything that may knowingly damage server integrity (i.e. causing lag, the server to crash, server-side glitches, etc.) is strictly forbidden.

  [bold]1.6[/bold] Erotic Roleplay (commonly abbreviated as "ERP") and sexual content is not allowed. This includes direct and indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. Roleplay involving romance should be kept PG-13, don't be overtly descriptive, and don't let it take up most of the available shift time.
