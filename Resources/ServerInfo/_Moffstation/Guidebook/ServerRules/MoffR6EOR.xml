  # Section 6: Safe Havens

  [bold]6.1[/bold] Safe Havens are areas where antagonist activity is expected to be minimal, and generally non-violent. These areas are as follows:
  - The arrivals planet.
  - The arrivals shuttle.
  - The areas on station where the arrivals shuttle docks.
  - The evac shuttle after it has departed the station.
  - Central Command.

  [bold]6.2[/bold] Disruptive behavior in safe havens is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Murder (both with objectives and without)
  - The usage of explosives.
  - The usage of lethal weapons.
  - Releasing harmful chemical bombs.
  - Breaking into secure areas.

  [bold]6.3[/bold] Within safe zones antagonists should lie low, not pursue their objectives, and not intentionally provoke encounters with security.

  [bold]6.4[/bold] Safe Havens are expected to remain habitable for crew throughout the course of the round, and not targets of destruction by antagonists.
  - Making the evac shuttle uninhabitable before it departs is still in violation of this rule.

  [bold]6.5[/bold] Hot pursuit rule: You are allowed to finish ongoing conflicts that carry over into safe havens.
  - This should still not result in an intentional breach of 6.4

  [bold]6.6[/bold] Do not take advantage of arrivals and the surrounding area to avoid antag activity
