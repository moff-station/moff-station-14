  # Section 6: End-of-Round, Evacuation, and Safe Havens

  [bold]6.1[/bold] Safe Havens are areas where antagonist activity is expected to be minimal, and generally non-violent. These areas are as follows:
  - The arrivals planet.
  - The arrivals shuttle.
  - The areas on station where the arrivals shuttle docks.
  - The evac shuttle after it has departed the station.
  - Central Command.

  [bold]6.2[/bold] Disruptive behavior in safe havens is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Murder (both with objectives and without)
  - The usage of explosives
  - The usage of lethal weapons.
  - Releasing harmful chemical bombs
  - Breaking into secure areas

  [bold]6.3[/bold] Within safe zones antagonists should lay low, not pursue their objectives, and not intentionally provoke encounters with security.

  [bold]6.4[/bold] Safe Havens are expected to remain habitable for crew throughout the course of the round, and not targets of destruction by antagonists.

  [bold]6.5[/bold] Do not take advantage of arrivals and the surrounding area to avoid antag activity
