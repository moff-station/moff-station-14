  # Section 6: End-of-Round, Evacuation, and Safe Havens

  [bold]6.1[/bold] Safe Havens are areas where antagonist activity is expected to be minimal, and generally non-violent. These areas are as follows:
  - The arrivals planet.
  - The arrivals shuttle.
  - The areas on station where the arrivals shuttle docks.
  - The evac shuttle after it has departed the station.*
  - Central Command.

  [bold]6.2[/bold] Disruptive behavior in safe havens is discouraged. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Murder (both with objectives and without)
  - The usage of explosives (both non-lethal and lethal)
  - The usage of lethal weapons.
  - Releasing harmful chemical bombs
  - Breaking into secure areas

  [bold]6.3[/bold] Violent encounters are bound to happen in safe havens, but they should be avoided by both crew and antagonists. 
  
  [bold]6.4[/bold] Antagonists are encouraged to pursue their objectives before the arrival of the evac shuttle.

  [bold]6.5[/bold] Safe Havens are expected to remain habitable for crew throughout the course of the round, and should not be targets of destruction by antagonists. Some leeway may be given for accidents, but generally antagonists should avoid causing trouble in these areas. 

  [bold]*[/bold] These may be ignored by [italic]Nuclear Operative Teams[/italic] (not Lone Operatives) or players with the [italic]Die a Glorious Death[/italic] objective.
