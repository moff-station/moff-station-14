  # Section 5: Death and New Life

  [bold]5.1[/bold] Players maintain all in-character memory up until the point of going into their unconscious/critical health state.

  [bold]5.2[/bold] Characters only retain vague memories of what happens around them while they are critical, asleep, or generally unconscious.

  [bold]5.3[/bold] If a player dies and is brought back to life by any means (including, but not limited to MMIs), they may only retain vague details of the events which occurred within the 5 minutes leading up to their death. Details such as their killer, the method, and how it specifically went down shouldn't be revealed in any meaningful capacity.

  [bold]5.4[/bold] Characters do not retain any knowledge of what happened while they were dead.

  [bold]5.5[/bold] If a player dies, cryos, or otherwise is round removed and returns to life by a means which causes them to have a new brain, they may not remember any details of their previous life. An execption is made to cloning, where they simply cannot remember any events of the current shift.

  [bold]5.6[/bold] This server provides players with the ability to respawn after they die or are otherwise removed from the round. When utilizing this feature, players are required to return to the round as a different character than any character they played previously in the round. Exceptions may be made at an admin's discretion.
