  # Public Displays of affection

  As a rule of thumb: if a normal person would do it in public, its allowed. If not, it isn't.

  Things like hugging, kissing, etc. are allowed. Things which involve sex or genitalia aren't.


  Jokes to that effect are judged based on context.
  Do not intentionally make other people unconformable.
