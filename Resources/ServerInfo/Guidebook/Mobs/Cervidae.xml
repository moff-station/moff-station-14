  Vulpkanin, due to their dense fur, are [color=#1e90ff]more resistant to cold temperatures[/color] and [color=#ffa500]heat up faster.[/color]
  Their sharp claws and teeth allow them to butcher corpses and do a mix of slash and piercing damage.

  Their weirdly shaped muzzle leads to difficulties drinking, making them sometimes spill small amounts of whatever they drank onto the ground.

  Thanks to their good sense of smell, they are able to determine the contents of solutions without the need for any specialized equipment.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]25% less Cold damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]20% more Heat damage.[/color].
