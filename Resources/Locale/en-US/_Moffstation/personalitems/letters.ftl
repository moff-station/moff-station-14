    Dear Cooks:
    
        I'm very glad to have seen you again, even more so on your specialty. You've been there since the very begining of my career since I got employed NanoTrasen, back when I was just some intern under Tee-Gam.
    
       While I'm now under the same mantle, I still appreciate what is possibly the sector's best chemist by a wide margin, and a great friend of mine. It's been a pleasure being with you all these months.
    
    Big hugs,
