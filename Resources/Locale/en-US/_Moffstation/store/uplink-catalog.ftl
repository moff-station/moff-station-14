uplink-hypereutatic-blade-moff-name = Hypereutactic Blade
uplink-hypereutatic-blade-moff-desc = A gigantic energy sword with power that matches its looks. Requires two hands to swing. Slow and unwieldy, yet pretty adept at reflecting projectiles and slicing through structures. Makes a lot of noise when turned on. Demons fear its hum.
